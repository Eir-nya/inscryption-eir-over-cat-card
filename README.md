# Inscryption - Eir over Cat

![](previews/preview-1.png)

Replaces Cat and Undead Cat with my OC. This change is purely cosmetic.

Also adds a custom starter deck for Kaycee's Mod to more easily see both forms in game.

## Dependencies

* [BepInExPack Inscryption](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Inscryption/)
* [Inscryption API](https://github.com/InscryptionModding/InscryptionAPI)
* [JSONCardLoader](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/MADH95Mods/JSONCardLoader/) (Their Github is strangely stuck on release v1.7.2, but the thunderstore page isn't. Huh.)
